###SFML Engine

After following an ebook called "Beginning C++ Game Programming" by John Horton, I wanted to start on my own project using the basic SFML framework. This is my attempt at building a 2D beat 'em up sidescroller game engine as a result. None of the assets (backgrounds, characters, sounds, etc.) on this project will be used in whatever "final" form the game may take, as these are all just proof of concept placeholders.
